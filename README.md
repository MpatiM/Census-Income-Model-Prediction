**Predicting if Income of Adults Exceeds $50k**

As per my Machine Learning course curriculum, completed the following project. The purpose of this project was to determine whether or not a person has an income that exceeds $50K per year dependent on various factors. As part of this project, data was extracted from the 1994 US Census database from UCI Machine Learning Repositor. Loaded the downloaded data from csv file, performed data cleaning by pre-processing and feature selection, replaced missing values with sentinels, split the training and test datasets with different split percentages, performed classification using the models Logistic Regression and SVC kernels using selected features, and plotted charts for data visualization. 
Performed additional model classification by selecting the best features. For feature selection, used the LASSO-Regression model method and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). Performed classification using the models Logistic Regression and SVC kernels on newly selected features. Plotted charts for data visualization.
After numerous trials in order to find the best machine learning classification model, comparing all the performed model predictions, the SVC RBF kernel classification combined with RFE had performed the best in determining whether or not an individual's income exceeds $50k per year.
